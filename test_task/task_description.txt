Your task is to write a program in any programming language of your choice (preferably in Python) that takes an XML file as a command line argument representing a flat list of employees and their managers.
The program should convert this flat structure into a hierarchical organizational chart, which will be represented in JSON format and written in a file.
This JSON should reflect the relationships between employees and their managers, making it easy to understand the management structure.
Implement this using only the standard library.

Along with the task description you receive 2 files (input_file_example.xml, output_file_example.json).
These files are provided to clarify the requirements of the task.
